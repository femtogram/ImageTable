==========

Description
-----------

A simple image viewer oriented toward artists who like to work with reference images.
Note that it is nowhere near done right now, THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Running
-------

For now, the way to run the program is to call
```bash
python imagetable.py
```
if Python is Python2 or
```bash
python2 imagetable.py
```

This will later be updated to allow for a more elegant way to run.
